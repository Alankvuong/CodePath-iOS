## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Added a custom tip feature so the user can input their own amount

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I didn't know how to use XCode's UI at first which made it a bit difficult for me to start the project. However, once I was able to access the object library and reserached more about how to use the interface, it became much easier.
- I didn't understand how to grab text from the text fields until I read the official documentation.
- I didn't know how to rename or edit an object's properties.
