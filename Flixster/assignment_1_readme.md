### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Some challenges building this app included figuring out how to things that were newly introduced such as creating a new ViewController
- I didn't know how to create a class so I had to rewatch the vidos a few time
- I'm still a bit confused on XCode's UI which took a while to figure out
- I messed up my git repostory a few times so I had to remake my repository on my local.
